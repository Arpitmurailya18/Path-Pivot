## Features

* **Dual-Mode Visualizer:** A versatile engine built to visualize both 1D array-based sorting algorithms and 2D grid-based pathfinding algorithms.
* **Interactive Simulation Environment:** Full user control over the visualization with real-time speed adjustments, play/pause functionality, and reset capabilities.
* **Dynamic Maze & Array Generation:** Interactively design complex mazes by placing walls and weights, or generate random mazes and arrays with a single click.
* **Comprehensive Algorithm Suite:** Implements a wide range of classic algorithms:
    * **Sorting:** Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort.
    * **Pathfinding:** Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Dijkstra's Algorithm, and A* Search.
* **Detailed Performance Statistics:** After each run, the application displays key performance metrics like comparisons, array accesses, path cost, and nodes visited, providing a clear analysis of each algorithm's efficiency.

## Tools & Technologies

* **Core:** C++
* **Graphics & Windowing:** SFML
* **Compiler:** g++ (MinGW)
* **Version Control:** Git / GitHub
